# pe2pectf

Distributed (but still centralized) network layer solution to organize Attack-Defence CTF.

Goals/Features:
- [ ] Provide a very simple way to host A&D CTF without complicated administration. Couple of commands and your network layer is ready. 
- [ ] Host your game on multiple low-end inexpensive hosts, instead of one expensive.
- [ ] Use of player machines as relay nodes to reduce the load on organizers infrastructure (implemented basic onion routing).
- [ ] Possible use of player-hosted relay nodes to provide better connectivity (without any impact on fairness of the competition).

Short-term TODO:

- [ ] Usage manual
- [ ] Configuration manual
- [ ] More unit tests
- [ ] More integration tests
- [ ] Tons of usability fixes

Long-term TODO:

- [ ] One-command CTF generator
- [ ] Extensive testing, load testing and benchmarking
