Short-term TODO:

- [ ] make some README
- [ ] allow exitnode to connect outside localhost (for use in docker-compose)
- [ ] tons of usability fixes

Long-term TODO:

- [ ] document everything in README
- [ ] one-click CTF generator
- [ ] onion-routing (and no need of trusted relays, only one lightweight coordinator node and some number of untrusted relays)
